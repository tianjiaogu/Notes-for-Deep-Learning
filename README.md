# Notes-for-Deep-Learning
I took Andrew NG's Deep Learning class on Coursera during one of my internship

I was very interested in the topics, but unforturnately didn't have the chance to practice the concepts on real world problems due to my busy schedule during the semester. I'm looking forward to explore deeper in the near future.
